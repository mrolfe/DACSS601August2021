## Start knitr chunks section, load libraries and read in data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
railroads <- read_excel("/Users/mahashraya/Documents/DACSS/DACSS601August2021/_data/StateCounty2012.xls", skip=4,
                        col_names = c("State", "delete1", "County", "delete2", "Total"))%>%
  select(!starts_with("delete"))%>%
  filter(!str_detect(State, "Total"))
library(rmarkdown)
railroad_table <- paged_table(railroads, options = list(rows.print = 20, cols.print = 10))
```

## Print paged table
```{r show table}
railroad_table
```
